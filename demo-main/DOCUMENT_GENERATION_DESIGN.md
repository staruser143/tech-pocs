## What's New

The documentation has been reorganized into modular sections:

### Core Design Documents
1. **Architecture Overview** ✅ - System design, components, and patterns
2. **Section Renderers** 🔄 - FreeMarker, AcroForm, Excel, and PDFBox renderers
3. **Field Mapping** 🔄 - Direct, JSONPath, JSONata, and repeating data strategies
4. **Headers & Footers** 🔄 - PDFBox and FreeMarker rendering options
5. **Storage Strategies** 🔄 - File system, database, cloud, Git, and Spring Cloud Config
6. **Template Patterns** 🔄 - ViewModel pattern and best practices

### Supplementary Documents
7. **API Reference** 🔄 - REST endpoints and examples
8. **Configuration Examples** 🔄 - Real-world template configurations
9. **Future Enhancements** 🔄 - Roadmap and planned features

> **Note:** The original comprehensive document has been archived as `DOCUMENT_GENERATION_DESIGN_ARCHIVE.md` and will be split into the above sections.

## Why the Change?

The original single document grew to **4600+ lines**, making it:
- ❌ Difficult to navigate
- ❌ Hard to find specific information
- ❌ Challenging to maintain
- ❌ Overwhelming for new users

The new structure provides:
- ✅ Focused, topic-specific documents
- ✅ Easy navigation with clear links
- ✅ Better organization and searchability
- ✅ Faster loading and rendering
- ✅ Easier maintenance and updates

## Getting Started

1. Start with the [Documentation Home](docs/README.md) for an overview
2. Read [Architecture Overview](docs/01-architecture-overview.md) to understand the system
3. The remaining sections are being migrated from the archive
4. Check the original archive file `DOCUMENT_GENERATION_DESIGN_ARCHIVE.md` for complete content

## Migration Status

- ✅ Documentation structure created
- ✅ README with navigation created
- ✅ Architecture Overview completed
- 🔄 Remaining sections to be extracted from archive
